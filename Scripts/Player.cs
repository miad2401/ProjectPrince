	 * All of these variables can be changed within the editor, but are not changed within the script
	 *
	 * xAcceleration - Changes how fast the player accelerates left/right
	 * maxHSpeed - Determines the maximum speed the player can go left/right
	 * maxVSpeed - Determines the minimum speed the player can go up/down
	 * jumpPower - Determines how high the player goes when they jump
	 * gravity - pulls the player down at a constant rate
	 * shotDelay - The time between each shot. Will be changed in the future
	 *
	 * shotTimePassed - The amount of time passed since the last shot, once a shot is fired is reset to shotDelay, then is decreased every frame by delta
	 * velocity - the Velocity of the player. It is a Vector2, meaning it contains 2 variables, x and y.
	 * direction - Used to determine what direction the player was last looking at,
	 *             usually the same as velocity, but has a value when velocity is (0,0)
	 *             Note: Only used for x-value
